# The Nest Planner

Parker, Aya, and I are building a scheduling assistant for Elizabethtown Collegeâ€™s course planning process. The tool will help generate optimized course schedules for the academic year, balancing faculty availability, classroom constraints, and departmental needs.

Our users will be the Elizabethtown College Administration, but specifically advisors for the Engineering and Computer Science Department.

## Tech Stack
- Google Firebase: Database
- JavaScript: Back-end
- Node.js: Back-end (Run time environment)
- React: Front-end (for mobile)
- React Native: Front-end (Transfer to web-based)


## External Requirements

List all the stuff the reader will need to install in order to get you app to
run in their laptop. For example:

In order to build this project you first have to install:

- [Google-Firestone]: ```npm install firebase```
- [package.json]: ```npm init -y```
- [Node.js]: check if node.js and npm are installed:
```
node-v
npm-v
```
- [React]: ```npm install react react-dom```
- [React-Native]: ```npm install -g react-natice-cli```

## Setup
Here is how you can Setup our application!
1. Git clone the project into your local terminal 
```
git clone https://github.com/Etown-CS/25-26_Administrative_Course_Planner.git

cd the-nest-planner
```
2. Install Dependencies in the project's package.json file
 ```
npm install

//or the shorthand
npm i
```

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running
1. start the project with
```
npm start
```
and scan the QR Code that pops up in the terminal. OR if you're using mobile, run:

```
npx expo start
```

# Deployment
Currently we are still under development and are not ready for deployment to the internet yet. We appreciate your understanding.
